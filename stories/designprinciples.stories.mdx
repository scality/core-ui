# Design Principles


## Consistency

Users learn faster how to use the product.  
Consistency eliminates confusion.  
Should be visual and functional.  

## Accessibility

### Contrast
The color of 1 element and its background should be a contrast color ratio of 4.5:1 at least.
That could be checked through various tools, such as [Webaim Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

### Color usage
The color should not be the only way of displaying information or action.  

### Keyboard user
The content and fields should be accessible through keyboard controls.

For forms, the Tab-key navigation should allow the user to submit the full form.
