## Implementation guidelines for next tabs component 

It should use text basic  component to display the labels 
The latest tabs should display the separation line at the end to mark the end of the tab

Expected component API : 

```
<Tabs variant={backgroundLevel3|backgroundLevel4}>
    <Tab path={string} label={} textBadge={} >{children}</Tab>
    <Tab path={string} label={} textBadge={} >{children}</Tab>
    <Tab path={string} label={} textBadge={} >{children}</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

Tabs are based on react router and extends the current route architecture of the application with child routes.
Each path is taken as a child path to the current router path.

Tab size depend on the label, minimum size is 5rem.

Scrollable tabs :
 - When there is too much tabs we display an arrow on top of the latest tab 
 - Click on this brings to the next "page" so for example if we have 10 tabs
   but the available space only displays 5, clicking next arrows will display 6,7,8,9,10
 - We display uncomplete tab label to show the possibility of scrolling
 - The next "page" starts with the uncomplete tab

Keyboard navigation : 
 - arrow left/right with focus on one of the tabs should highlight/focus the next/prev tab
 - space/enter trigger tab openning
 - when the tabs are scrollable the next/prev button are not focusable, we use arrows to browse the tabs (same as material ui)

Requirements  : 

Badge component :

```
<TextBadge variant={} >{text}</TextBadge>
```

Extend TextEmphasis but check the line-height (it should not impact the component render arround)
