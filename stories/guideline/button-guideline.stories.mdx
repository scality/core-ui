### Disabled button

Disabled state only if an action on the current screen can enable it (action possibility).

## Placement

- Primary buttons placed on the right of a group.
- Dismissive actions placed on the left. It allows the user to return to the previous screen or step in the process.

Align button groups with the container's right side by default; however, based on the use case and visual balance it can be aligned differently.

- Vertical spacing: 12px
- Space between 2 buttons: 24px - when there is no space constraint

## Icon & label on buttons

### Which icon

Every button gets a label.  
Icons are optional and mainly used to show how buttons are different, to aid memory and differentiation.  
Universally understood icons work well (ie. print, close, play/pause, save).  
Use standard icons when their use matches their meaning, or at least the user's intent.  
Avoid creating new icons for every action, especially infrequently used ones.  
Avoid using an icon alone in a button, with no label.

### Placement

If icon + label, then the icon is placed on the left side.  
Seeing the icon first help users to scan the page more easily, except for few cases such as navigation (right arrow).

### Size

The icon should be (approximately) the same height as the text, or a lot bigger.

### Explicit button label

Button labels should be as short and clear as possible and should describe the action the button performs.  
Use one or two words if possible. Remove most prepositions and articles (a, an, the).

Examples: Cancel, Close, Create, Delete, Edit, Learn more, Review, Save, Study, View scores, etc.

Since buttons are action points for the user, button text should also be actionable. Stick to using verbs (Complete, Start/Finish, Search) or a simple verb + noun combination for buttons (Next Page, Submit Post, Learn More). Whichever labeling method you choose, maintain consistency across all of your buttons.

- Use sentence case.
- Capitalize proper nouns.
- Use specific action-oriented text for CTAs.

Examples: Add Volume, Create Account, Go to Dashboard, Reset Password, Send Reset link, Sign in, etc.

Be sure to:

- Check for consistent use across the UI.
- Reserve enough space for translation to other languages.
- Avoid excessive use of exclamation points (!).

Don't:

- Use icons only.
- Use punctuation.
- Write “Click here.”
