# Charts

Used mostly for monitoring-related tasks.

## UI

### Tooltips

Don’t depend too heavily on tooltips. They are as providing supplemental or expanded information, but shouldn’t be the only way a user can see the plotted value.

### Grid lines

Only use grid lines when it’s helpful. Possible to use only horizontal or vertical.

### Elements

- Title
- Axis
- Legend

## Type

4 types for most cases: pie/donut, bar/column, line, or area.

### Pie charts

- No more than 6 categories
- Values should be different enough (otherwise select Bar charts)
- Should be a 100% total
- Categories in the desc order

_(Currently, there is no Pie chart in the UI)_

### Bar and column charts

- should start at a baseline of zero.

### Line charts

- No more than 5–7 different lines
- avoid randomly chosen color (otherwise risk if contrast issues)

Here, the colors for Get and List are too close.

Area charts

- could be a single area, overlapping area, or stacked area
- max 3-4 categories
