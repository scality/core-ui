## Padding

### Vertical padding
Button’s label has a line height of 20px and vertical padding of 8px.

### Horizontal padding
2 logics: Grid (one size for all buttons) versus padding.  
The choice is the horizontal padding of 16px


With icon: 8px between icon & label

## Placement

-Primary buttons placed on the right of a group.
-Dismissive actions placed on the left. It allows the user to return to the previous screen or step in the process.
Align button groups with the container's right side by default; however, based on the use case and visual balance you can align differently.


Don’t forget the whitespace around the button.


### Button spacing  
- Horizontal spacing: 16px  
- Vertical spacing: 12px  

Between 2 buttons : 24px, when there is no space constraint


## Labels

Guideline for icon & label on buttons.

Every button gets a label, icons are optional and mainly used to show how buttons are different.
Universally understood icons work well (ie. print, close, play/pause, save). Use standard icons when their use matches their meaning, or at least the user's intent. Avoid creating new icons for every action, especially infrequently used ones.
Carefully consider creating new icons to denote the primary path through your application as long as they will be repeated or paired with frequently used actions to aid memory and differentiation.

Never use an icon alone.

If icon + label, then put the icon on the left side (Seeing the icon first will help users to scan the page more easily)

if the icon is only a little bit bigger than the cap-height, it will look unbalanced or like a mistake. It should either be approximately the same cap-height, or a lot bigger — avoid inbetweens.



Explicit button label
Button labels should be as short and clear as possible and should describe the action the button performs.

Do:
Try to limit it to three words or less. Use one or two words if possible. Remove most prepositions and articles (a, an, the).

Examples: Cancel, Close, Create, Delete, Edit, Learn more, Review, Save, Study, View scores, etc.

Since buttons are action points for the user, button text should also be actionable. Stick to using verbs (Complete, Start/Finish, Search)  or a simple verb + noun combination for buttons (Next Page, Submit Post, Learn More). Whichever labeling method you choose, maintain consistency across all of your buttons.

- Use sentence case.
- Capitalize proper nouns.
- Use specific action-oriented text for CTAs.

Examples: Add Volume, Create Account, Go to Dashboard, Reset Password, Send Reset link, Sign in, etc.

Be sure to:  
- Check for consistent use across the UI.
- Reserve enough space for translation to other languages.
- Avoid excessive use of exclamation points (!).

Don't:  
- Use icons only.
- Use punctuation.
- Write “Click here.”



## Disabled button

Use a disabled button only if an action on the current screen can enable it (action possibility).
