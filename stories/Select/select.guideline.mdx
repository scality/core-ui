# Select

## Size & Style

## Usage

Use the select component to allow the user to choose between defined options.
You can use icons to differentiates the different options; in this case, all labels should have icons.

## Variations

The select component come with multiple props allowing customization and adaptation to various scenarios.

### Size variations

By default the Select component width is 20.5rem .
You can reduce its size by defining the 'size' props to two third, half or one third of the default size :

<Story of={SelectStories.DifferentSizes} />

### Options number

Depending on the number of options provided to the select, different features will be automatically enabled.

#### No option

When no option are provided, a clear information will be given to the user

<Story of={SelectStories.WithoutOptions} />

#### Scrollbar:

When the number of options exceeds four, a scrollbar appears, allowing users to scroll through the available options.

<Story of={SelectStories.WithScrollbar} />

#### Searchbar:

If the number of options is greater than eight,
a search bar is automatically added, enabling users to quickly find and select options.

<Story of={SelectStories.WithSearchBar} />

### Disable state

#### Select

The Select component can be easily disabled, preventing user interaction.
This is useful in scenarios where user input is not allowed or required

<Story of={SelectStories.DisabledSelect} />

#### Options

The Option component can also be disabled, preventing its selection by the user.

<Canvas
  of={SelectStories.WithDisabledOptionsWithoutMessage}
  sourceState="hidden"
  layout="fullscreen"
/>

You can also give more information to the user by adding a disabledReason prop to Option.

<Canvas
  of={SelectStories.WithDisabledOptionsWithMessage}
  sourceState="hidden"
  layout="fullscreen"
/>

### Dropdown Placement

In cases where there is limited space at the bottom of the viewport,
the dropdown menu opens toward the top to ensure visibility and usability.
