Buttons are used to trigger an action or event when clicked.

## Size & style

- Minimum width: 5rem

{/* if different sizes, add story with different the different and their size in rem */}

### Padding

Button’s label measurement:

- Line height: 1.25rem
- Vertical padding: 0.5rem
- Horizontal padding of 1rem
- Space between icon & label: 0.5rem

### Button spacing

- Horizontal spacing: 1rem
- Vertical spacing: 0.75rem
- Space between 2 buttons: 1.5rem - when there is no space constraint

## Usage

Button labels should be as short and clear as possible and should describe the action the button performs.\
Use one or two words if possible. Remove most prepositions and articles (a, an, the).

Examples: Cancel, Close, Create, Delete, Edit, Learn more, Review, Save, Study, View scores, etc.

Since buttons are action points for the user, button text should also be actionable. \
Stick to using verbs (Complete, Start/Finish, Search) or a simple verb + noun combination for buttons (Next Page, Submit Post, Learn More). \
Whichever labeling method you choose, maintain consistency across all of your buttons.

- Use sentence case.
- Capitalize proper nouns.
- Use specific action-oriented text for CTAs.

{/* Examples: Add Volume, Create Account, Go to Dashboard, Reset Password, Send Reset link, Sign in, etc. */}

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent:"space-around" }}>
  <ul>
    Do
    <li>Check for consistent use across the UI</li>
    <li>Reserve enough space for translation to other languages</li>
    <li>Avoid excessive use of exclamation points (!)</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    Don't
    <li>Use icons only</li>
    <li>Use punctuation</li>
    <li>Write “Click here”</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Variations

The button can be modify in different way to match its usage

### Variant

For example, “Continue” in a form.

<Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

<Story of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

<Story of={ButtonStories.Danger} />

_Usecases of the different sizes ?_

<Story of={ButtonStories.ButtonSizes} />

### States

#### Disabled button

Disabled state only if an action on the current screen can enable it (action possibility).

<Story of={ButtonStories.ButtonDisabled} />

## Group of Button

- Primary buttons placed on the right of a group.
- Dismissive actions placed on the left. It allows the user to return to the previous screen or step in the process.

Align button groups with the container's right side by default; however, based on the use case and visual balance it can be aligned differently.

<Story of={ButtonStories.SimpleForm} />

## Icon on buttons

Every button gets a label.\
Icons are optional and mainly used to show how buttons are different, to aid memory and differentiation.\
Universally understood icons work well (ie. print, close, play/pause, save).\
Use standard icons when their use matches their meaning, or at least the user's intent.\
Avoid creating new icons for every action, especially infrequently used ones.\
Avoid using an icon alone in a button. If no label is provide, then use a tooltip

### Placement

When use with a label, the icon is placed on the left side.\
Seeing the icon first help users to scan the page more easily, except for few cases such as navigation (right arrow).

<Story of={ButtonStories.ButtonsWithIcon} />

Avoid using an icon without label, used Universally understood icons such as Save or Delete.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.IconButtonWithTooltip} />

### Size

The icon should be (approximately) the same height as the text, or a lot bigger.

### Ghost Buttons

Ghost buttons are subtle and contribute to a minimalist interface design.  
They are low-emphasis, making them ideal for non-primary actions in UIs.  
They're also effective in space-limited areas like tables or key-value lists.
